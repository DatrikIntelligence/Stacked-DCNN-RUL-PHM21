This work is divided in two phases or levels:
  - Level 1 (encoding) has the goal to make a dimesion reduction and noise removal. 
  - Level 2 (trending) has the goal the learn from the trend of the signal using the encodings generated by the level 1.

### Level 1 training

For training the level 1 models you only have to execute the script *train_l1.py* allocated in the directory 
*src/commands*. 

```
python train_l1.py
```

This is a example of the execution trace:
